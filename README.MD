## DRS-Parsing as BERT Sequence Labeling
This is a semantic parser converting natuarl language text into Discourse Representation Structure (DRS) defined in Parallel Meaning Bank (Abzianidze et al. 2017). The parser using a sequence labeling architecture with pretrained language model - BERT that produces DRSs by predicting and combining three labels, namely *word senses*, *fragment* and *integration labels*, in which the *fragment* is an underspecified lexical meaning representation that is introduced in Evang(2019).
